# FOGM in Allan Variance
This notebook is a way to find out some information about how FOGM (First Order Gauss Markov) noise is represented in an Allan Variance chart. 

[This Overleaf link](https://www.overleaf.com/project/640227a87ad32ad1a54a5621) has the derivations for the functions used in the Python Notebook.

[This Notebook](notebooks/AllanVariance-FOGM.ipynb) is where we are trying things out and is the point of this github CodeSpaces.
